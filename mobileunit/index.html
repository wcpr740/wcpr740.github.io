                          <li>The organization booking WCPR assumes all financial responsibility for damage to equipment.</li>
                          <li>The booking organization understands that WCPR is to be paid for the labor involved with the event. Recognized Student Organizations shall not be held responsible for the costs of equipment excepting under special circumstances defined in this contract. All other booking parties may incur additional fees at the discretion of WCPR.</li>
                          <li>Equipment fees will be levied in the event that equipment requested is unneeded due to foreseeable causes or circumstances of miscommunication between the organization booking and WCPR and/or the group they booked. The organization booking will not be held responsible for excessive equipment that was not requested. The fees may also be levied for any additional equipment requested above as it adds to the set-up time for the event.</li>
                          <li>WCPR crew present will consist of at least 1 staff member, and 1 technical support member (if possible).</li>
                          <li>The overtime penalty will be levied after an event has transpired. Overtime is defined as time in excess of the agreed-on duration of an event (i.e. lasting 3 hours instead of 2), and does not count setup/breakdown. In the event that WCPR is told that an event starts at a time that is earlier or later than the time the event actually starts, WCPR reserves the right to charge overtime for those hours.
                          <li>If WCPR is booked less than or equal to 72 hours before the event starts, then WCPR reserves the right to charge both late booking fees and to decline the booking.</li>
                          <li>Payment methods: For RSOs/Stevens organizations, payment must be rendered by Interdepartmental Transfer Form. For outside organizations, payment must be rendered in cash or check ONLY. If a check is used, it must be made out to Stevens Institute of Technology and sent to WCPR's mailbox (Box S-1461, 1 Castle Point Ter, Hoboken NJ 07030) within 1 week after the event. If the event is off of campus grounds, then appropriate fees will be applied (e.g. transportation fees). All transportation fees must be paid in cash.</li>
                          <li>For every on-campus event, the organization booking must supply an electrician from Physical Plant. An electrician may not be required only at WCPR’s discretion.</li>
                          <li>Please allow two weeks prior to the event date for the WCPR Staff to respond their availability. If the event is submitted within two weeks prior to the event date, allow the WCPR Staff one week after submission to respond their availability. WCPR reserves the right to decline any event at any point.</li>
                          <li>By endorsing this contract, the booking organization and WCPR agree to the above terms. This is a legally binding contract.</li>

                    <h3>What is a Mobile Unit?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">Mobile Units are student-run live sound and lights services provided
by WCPR. If you see our table at a campus event, we're playing music,
organizing lights, or running sound for the organization running the
event. <br>
Mobile Units are another part of what WCPR does, alongside
other efforts like providing original programming as a radio station,
recording in our studios, and putting on concerts on campus.

                    <h3>What services does a Mobile Unit provide?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">We offer a ton of different sound and light options for whatever
your organization needs for an event. Find all of them in the
<a href="#docs">Mobile Units Packages & Prices</a> document.<br>
If you have any questions about our packages, feel free to email us at
<a href="mailto:mobileunit@wcpr.org">mobileunit@wcpr.org</a>

                    <h3>How does Mobile Unit pricing work?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">Our pricing varies per package and per your needs. Most of our packages
have a <strong>flat fee</strong> for equipment and setup, and
any of our staffed packages have an <strong>hourly rate</strong> for
operating the equipment.<br>
Equipment set-up and breakdown are not included in the hourly fees.
<br><br>
Anything booked within ten days will incur a <strong>late fee</strong>.
<br>
Events held off-campus include a <strong>transportation fee</strong>
for moving equipment.<br>
Events that run overtime will be charged an <strong>overtime fee</strong>
<br>
Any event cancelled less than 48 hours prior to the event will incur
a <strong>cancellation fee</strong>.
<br><br>
<em>An item of note:</em> WCPR staff are student volunteers and are
not paid for their time. The money you pay goes directly to repairing
and updating our equipment as it wears and ages.

                    <h3>How do I book a Mobile Unit?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">Please fill out the <a href="#booking">Mobile Unit Request form</a>.
<strong>Until you've submitted that form, we cannot consider your
event nor can we assess our staff availability.</strong> Keep in mind
that the closer to your event you submit this, the less likely it is
for our staff to be available (we are all student volunteers!).
<br><br>
Please review our <a href="#docs">Mobile Unit Contract</a> document to find
detailed information concerning staffing, overtime, and other policies
in accordance with Mobile Units.

                    <h3>I submitted the form - what happens now?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">Great! Our staff will now be coordinating volunteer availability for
your event. Please allow us until two weeks prior to your event date
before our response. Once this has happened, you will get an email
with one of two outcomes:
<ul>
  <li>
  In the event we have staff available for your event, it will be
  <strong>Approved</strong>. If you have special requests (e.g. a
  certain kind of music you'd like to be played, specific lighting
  arrangements, etc.), do not hesitate to contact us at
  <a href="mailto:mobileunit@wcpr.org">mobileunit@wcpr.org</a>
  <br>
  <strong>Note</strong>: If you have any live artist, band, DJ, etc.
  at your event, <em>coordination is necessary</em> between us, you,
  and your act(s).
  </li>
  <li>
  In the event we do not have staff available for your event, it will
  be <strong>Denied</strong>. Please contact the Office of Student Life
  (10th floor of Howe) for additional options if sound and/or lighting
  services are integral to your event.
  </li>
</ul>
We may also reach out before our decision if we need more information
on the event.

                    <h3>How will the day of the event go?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">We will be arriving early to set up our equipment - how early we show
up depends on the package your organization booked, but in general
we will arrive at least an hour before the event start time.
<br><br>
Following the event, the organization will be billed for WCPR's
services through coordination between our
<a href="/contact/#staff_business">Business Manager</a> and the Office
of Student Life. Contact
<a href="mailto:business@wcpr.org">business@wcpr.org</a> with any
billing questions.
